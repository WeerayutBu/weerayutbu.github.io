            <div class="section-title">Summary</div>
            <p>I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the Natural Language Processing and Representation Learning (NRL) Lab
                at VISTEC, Thailand, under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Dr. Sarana Nutanong and co-supervision of
                Assoc. Prof. Dr. Attapol Rutherford.</p>
            <p>My research focuses on information extraction tasks, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Representation
                Learning. My work aims to address the challenges in NER, including limited resources for Thai NER,
                issues related to open class problems with unseen and long-tail entities, and multilingual and
                domain-specific. My co-authors and I have previously worked on developing a Thai Fine-grained Nested NER
                dataset to bridge the gap between low-resource and high-resource languages. Additionally, we have
                explored few-shot learning techniques, leveraging large language models to generate relevant examples
                and enhance the effectiveness of few-shot NER.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am focusing on creating a bilingual finance-NER dataset in Thai and English to study
                knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages.</p>

            <p>We got 2nd place in the RMUT group IoT competition in Thailand. We used an ESP20 to read sensor data and
                send it via MQTT to a Raspberry Pi server, which visualized the data on a web interface. I programmed
                the visualization and configured the ESP20 while my friend handled the hardware connections</p>

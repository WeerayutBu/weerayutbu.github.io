            <p>I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Natural Language Processing and Representation Learning Lab (NRL) at VISTEC, Thailand, co-supervised by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Sarana and Assoc. Prof. Dr. Attapol.</p>
            <p>My research focuses on information extraction tasks, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Representation Learning. My work aims to address the challenges in NER, including limited resources for Thai NER, issues related to open class problems with unseen and long-tail entities, and multilingual and domain-specific. My co-authors and I have previously worked on developing a Thai Fine-grained Nested NER dataset to bridge the gap between low-resource and high-resource languages. Additionally, we have explored few-shot learning techniques, leveraging large language models to generate relevant examples and enhance the effectiveness of few-shot NER.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am focusing on creating a bilingual finance-NER dataset in Thai and English to study knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource languages.</p>
